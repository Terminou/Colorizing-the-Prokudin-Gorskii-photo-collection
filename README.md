# Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection
 CMPE362 HW1
 
 My program takes a glass plate image as an input, splits them into 3 channels B, G, R respectively. Then, it creates a color image. Aligns the channels with two different function alignSSD and alignNCC. Beside aligments, there are also contrast improvement methods in the code like histogram equalization, gamma correction or HSV value change. 
 
 Please check output images and report.pdf to get more details about the project.
